# Selenium Python Project Using OrangeHRM Demo Login Page

This project consists of a simple script to login to the [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) web page. This is my initial portfolio project that I will improve upon as I gain more knowledge on Selenium Test Automation.

As I gain more skills in Test Automation, I have also successfully integrated this script using Jenkins.
